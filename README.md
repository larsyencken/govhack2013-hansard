# GovHack 2013: Hansard Hack

## The project

To analyse hansard transcripts from Australian House of Representatives and Senate debates, in order to better track the topic and tone of political in Australia.

## The team

Our team "Science, you monster" had four members:

- Daniel Heath
- Lars Yencken
- Olivia March
- Rhiana Heath

## This codebase

This codebase drives a "bubble visualisation" of political debate, and concerns itself with the text-processing aspects of working with hansard text.

It makes use of:

- [drake](https://github.com/Factual/drake): a data workflow tool
- [NLTK](http://nltk.org/): the Natural Language Toolkit
- [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/): a web framework for Python
- [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/): a Python data analysis library

## Useful links

- [OpenAustralia.org](http://www.openaustralia.org/): a site providing enriched hansard documents
